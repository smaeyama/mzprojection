*** For Fortran users ***

  Mori-Zwanzig projection module is "mzprojection.f90" in "./fortran/".

  ### Running a sample program ###
  cd ./fortran/
  sh compile_and_run.sh

  Mori-Zwanzig projection is applied to "./sample_data/sample_time_series.dat".
  Output files describe the Memory function, uncorrelated term, and so on.

  See "README.txt" and the sample program "example.f90" for details.

 

*** For Python users ***

  Mori-Zwanzig projection module is "mzprojection.py" in "./python/".

  ### Running a sample program ###
  cd ./python/
  python example.py

  Mori-Zwanzig projection is applied to "./sample_data/sample_time_series.dat".
  Output files describe the Memory function, uncorrelated term, and so on.

  See "README.txt" and the sample program "example.py" for details.

  * If you use jupyter-notebook, "./python/Demo_Aug2020.ipynb" will be
    a convenient example with graphical interpretation.
